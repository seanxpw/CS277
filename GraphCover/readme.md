Original folder contains the NP-hard solution
greedy is the approximate one.

`GraphCover/Approximate/vertex_cover_greedy_20250601_184026/dataset_readme.txt`
```
Dataset generated by Python script using an EXACT brute-force algorithm for Vertex Cover.
Data type for inputs (adjacency matrices): numpy.int8
Shape for inputs: (200, 20, 20) (num_samples, num_vertices, num_vertices)

Data type for labels (OPTIMAL cover vectors): numpy.int8
Shape for labels: (200, 20) (num_samples, num_vertices)

Generation details:
- Number of samples: 200
- Number of vertices per graph: 20
- Edge probability (G(n,p) model): 0.1
- Algorithm for vertex cover: Exact brute-force algorithm (guarantees minimum vertex cover).

```

these readmes give more info of how the numpy is formated.

you can find

```
# --- Parameters for Dataset Generation ---
fixed_num_vertices = 1000     # Fixed number of vertices
num_samples = 5           # Number of graph samples to generate
edge_probability = 0.1   # Probability for an edge to exist
```

in both `GraphCover/Approximate/greedy_generator.py` and `GraphCover/Original/optimal_generator.py`. change it as you wish and it will generate some more data.

All matrixes are adjecency matrixes. And the output (label) is the a vector of vertex ids.
